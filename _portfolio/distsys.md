Developed a causally consistent, available, and eventually consistent key-value store, extending its capabilities to include horizontal scaling through sharding. Implemented mechanisms for dynamic data redistribution and causal consistency enforcement across multiple shards. Engineered the system to efficiently handle view changes and minimize data movement during reconfigurations, with a focus on optimized performance for large-scale key-value storage. This project involved deep dives into distributed system design, including robust API development for key-value operations and view management, and ensuring data integrity across a distributed network.

Project was developed in a team of 4 for CSE 138: Distributed Systems.
