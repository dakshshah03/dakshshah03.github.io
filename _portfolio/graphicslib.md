Created an interactive WebGL graphics engine from scratch, progressively implementing 3D primitives, perspective camera navigation, and lighting models. Built custom GLSL shaders to support Blinn-Phong shading, interleaved vertex buffers, and UV texture mapping for efficient real-time rendering.
Developed a modular pipeline with dynamic geometry and scene composition. In a final creative assignment, extended a Three.js-based scene with custom shaders to simulate dynamic auroras in the skybox and real-time surface reflections for immersive visual effects.

Project was developed as a capstone for CSE 160: Introduction to Computer Graphics.
