Hi there! I am a rising fourth year undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics Theory & Computation. I'm driven by my passion to help computers "see" more than a 2D image, but understand depth and context in autonomous decision-making. Over time, I realized the most exciting progress in vision and graphics required deep knowledge of systems, optimization, and machine learning. That's why I split my focus between high-level algorithms and low-level performance engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new tech.

Coursework
======
Computer Science
------
Beyond the standard CS curriculum, I've taken courses in distributed systems, deep learning, and computer graphics.

For a more challenging workload, I have taken <u>graduate-level</u> coursework on **advanced computer vision**, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and seminar-based advanced topic courses in machine learning covering **NeuroSymbolic AI** and **Differentiable Programming**.

Mathematics
------
So far, I have taken a graduate-level statistics course covering data science and bayesian statistics. Among pure math coursework, I enjoyed **real analysis** and **advanced linear algebra**.
