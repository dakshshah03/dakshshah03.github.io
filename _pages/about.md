Hi there! I am a rising fourth year undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics Theory & Computation. I'm driven by my passion to help computers "see" more than a 2D image, but understand depth and context in autonomous decision-making. Over time, I realized the most exciting progress in vision and graphics required deep knowledge of systems, optimization, and machine learning. That's why I split my focus between high-level algorithms and low-level performance engineering.



Outside of AI/ML, I have an interest in operating systems and low-level systems programming. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new tech.

Research
======
I am interested in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, particularly in the area of 3D reconstruction and scene understanding. I am also interested in the application of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these processes.

Bridging 3D Computer Vision with Systems-Level Performance Optimization
======
*From real-time AR reconstruction to distributed systems, I'm passionate about building high-performance, intelligent systems that perceive and understand the world in 3D.* -->

Coursework
======
Computer Science
------
Beyond the standard CS curriculum, I've taken courses in distributed systems, deep learning, and computer graphics.

For a more challenging workload, I have taken <u>graduate-level</u> coursework on **advanced computer vision**, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and seminar-based advanced topic courses in machine learning covering **NeuroSymbolic AI** and **Differentiable Programming**.

Mathematics
------
So far, I have taken a graduate-level statistics course covering data science and bayesian statistics. Among pure math coursework, I enjoyed **real analysis** and **advanced linear algebra**.
